ABOUT GIMI:

GTA IV Mod Installer  (GIMI) allows you to install mods and custom vehicles made for GTA IV

without having to edit the game files yourself. GIMI practically does all of the work for you, which makes mod 

installing (and uninstalling) as easy as a few clicks.

	-All files and information will be backed up before the mod is installed (to allow uninstalls)

	-All actions are performed according to the information in the script (no input is required from the user)

	-Actions in a script are performed in the order they are positioned in the script file

	-Mod information is displayed before the mod is installed (mod name, email, website, description, etc)

	-Ability to include multiple scripts with a single mod. Useful if there's multiple options for installing the mod.
